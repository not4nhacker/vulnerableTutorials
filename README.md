# vulnerableTutorials
## What is this?
This is a PHP Web Application with a bunch of vulns. It's good for Infosec Newbies that want to tryout their skills.

## Scenario
This Web App simulate a platform in which you can buy some plans and start courses about stuff depending of which plan you have.

## Reports
I want to make this a place where everyone can share their skills, and methodology, so I created a Reports folder in this repository. Once you finished this challenge, write a report and open a pull request in which you upload your report in this folder, so other users can check for some hints or find new ways to test some cool stuff.

## WARNINGS
+ This code is probably a messy. Right Now this is the last exercise I have to do for my graduation, so I still have to use mysqli and a lot of others Bad Things
+ Right Now just the Back-End of this App is created, so this works, it's very ugly but works. I'm working on the front-end at the moment
+ I don't know what vulns are there either, I created this as school project and I didn't focused on create some specific vulns 
+ Because this is a school project and I'm studying in Italy, all the comments and the User Interface are in Italian, after graduation I'll fix it.

## Usage
+ Clone it or download
+ Put it under Apache or XAMPP
+ The first page is index.php, so make sure to visit that page first of all
